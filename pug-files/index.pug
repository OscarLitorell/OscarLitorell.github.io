            p My name is Oscar Litorell and I enjoy programming, web-development and pretty much anything that has anything to do with technology. I currently live and study in Sweden.

                Programming is one of the things I enjoy doing the most. I mainly do programming in Python, C# .NET (with Unity) and JS (frontend as well as backend with Node and ExpressJS). You can find some of the things I've created on my #[a(href="https://github.com/OscarLitorell") GitHub page], or alternatively, you can check out a selection of my projects #[a(href="/developer") here].

                Building and tinkering with things is another passion of mine - be it 3D-printing, soldering circuits, programming Raspberry Pis and Arduinos, or building RC planes. You can check out a selection of my projects #[a(href="/maker") here].
