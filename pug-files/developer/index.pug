        hr.developer.filled
        p.
            This is a program that simplifies the creation of secure passwords. Instead of having to remember several different passwords for different websites, you can generate your password on the fly with the help of one master password. In other words, no password is stored. Instructions on how to add it to your browser can be found on the #[a(href="https://github.com/OscarLitorell/password-hasher") GitHub page].

            This program can take in any number up to 10#[sup 3003] and write it out correctly using words. Did you know that the number 300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 is pronounced &quot;three hundred decillion&quot;?
