        p.
            You can choose to use the short scale (where 10#[sup 9] is 1 billion) or the long scale (where 10#[sup 9] is 1 milliard). You can read more about the differences between the long and short scale #[a.inP(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales') here]. If you choose to use the long scale the limit goes up to 10#[sup 6,000] instead. It's also possible to use numbers with decimals.
