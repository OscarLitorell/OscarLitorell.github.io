                This is a throttle lever specifically designed for Elite Dangerous, but can be used in other flight simulators as well. It is modeled in blender around the Leo Bodnar #[a(href="https://www.leobodnar.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=204") BU0836A] board, and features one major thrust axis, 8 pushbuttons, one small thumbstick with a built-in pushbutton, and 2 rotary encoders. It is 3D-printed in PETG (polyethylene).

                This is a project that I have started working on. My goal is to build a working submarine, where the pitch is controlled by shifting weights inside the sub. You can see ethe pipe pieces that I am going use to build it, along with the laser-cut piece of acrylic glass that will be used for the window. The plan is that it's going to be controlled with a tether (an ethernet cable), which hopefully means that it will be possible to transmit video as well.
